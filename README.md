# Fifty Fizzbuzzes

#### An Extreme Programming Exercise by Vi Hart

*[Here's my blog post about this project.](http://vihart.com/fifty-fizzbuzzes/)*

One of the many things I learned from Evelyn Eastmond in my time working with her is this technique for deeply exploring, releasing yourself from preconceptions, thinking in new ways.

You make 50 of something.
In one big marathon.
(Maybe spaced over a few days, but it's important to exhaust your possibilities to break and illuminate habits, rather than making habits as with making a thing a week.) 

50 is a LOT, and it takes you on this weird journey of ups and downs and complexifying and simplifying and combining and taking apart.
It can be oddly emotional and intense.

This technique was meant for artists, but my research group has used it for VR stuff and programming language design too.
So now to learn python, over the weekend I made 50 implementations of fizzbuzz.

Fizzbuzz is a classic simple programming exercise and common interview question based on a classic kids game, where you take turns counting, but if the number is divisible by 3 you say \"fizz\", and if it's divisible for 5 you say \"buzz\", and if it's divisible by both you say \"fizzbuzz\".

* Ok, so this is a jupyter notebook, so if you want to run stuff you'll need to download this and open it, for which you might need [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

* Luckily twitter user @quasiben made [a version that works online, go here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/quasiben/fiftyfizzbuzzes/master?filepath=Fifty%20Fizzbuzzes.ipynb) and click Fifty Fizzbuzzes.ipynb

* To run the examples, click in the box and press ctrl+enter. 

* Each numbered section is independently runnable unless otherwise noted.
(For sections with multiple boxes you might have to run the parts above it for it to work.) 

* If things break or get weird, try kernel -> restart & clear output

* ...but things are going to get weird no matter what.

* Feel free to skip around. Some have visuals, some have sound.
48 is a complete text adventure.
